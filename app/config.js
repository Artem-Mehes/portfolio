        <p>
          I am a Front-End Developer driven by an curiosity and a profound love
          for technology. My journey into the world of programming began with
          HTML during my university years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constantly expanding my skill set. I&apos;m not just passionate
          about keeping up with the latest trends in front-end technologies;
          I&apos;m also actively diving into backend development. My goal is to
          evolve into a{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-accent">full-stack developer</span>,
          equipped to handle the complexities of both client and server-side
          programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my quest for knowledge, I&apos;ve tackled projects ranging from
          internal company initiatives to complex applications in the fitness
          and veterinary sectors, and more recently, the dynamic world of
          cryptocurrencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a detail-oriented developer, I strive to refine every aspect of the
          user experience while contributing to the bigger picture of each
          project.
